# Voting Jokes Backend

This is the backend part of the **Voting Jokes** project, a fun web application where users can vote on daily jokes using emoji reactions. The backend is built using **Node.js** with **Express** and **MongoDB** for data storage. It provides a RESTful API for the frontend to fetch jokes, submit votes, and manage joke data.
